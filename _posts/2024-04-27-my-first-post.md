Hello world! This is my first post!  

I've actually created the same website (with the same name) around four hours ago (and finished around one hour ago), but I couldn't figure what went wrong with the dark-and-light mode switcher. I decided to delete all three hours of work and start a new one.  

This is the fourth time of me using GitHub to create a personal blog...  

My blogging (or more like personal website because I didn't write that many blogs lol) went like this: **Wix** (two websites; I messed up one and made a second) - **Wordpress** (three websites, one personal, one personal but I would write it on my resume, one public for the TEDxYouth event I organized) - **GitHub Pages** (maybe around four because the last three failed; the first one I used the Jekyll theme Hitchens and the rest I used the Jekyll theme Chirpy)  

Hopefully this will start my new journey of creating/writing fun and interactive websites myself!
